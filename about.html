            <strong> Colorado Native | Author | Poet | Artist</strong>
          </h3>
          <div class="story">
            <p>
              One day, several years ago, I was walking on the golf course
              behind my home in <strong>Fort Morgan, Colorado</strong>. I have
              always been a writer, particularly of poetry. But that day, as I
              walked, words simply came to my mind. I ran home and began to
              <span class="highlight-story">write, write, write</span> before I
              forgot the details. I wrote every chance I could to build a
              story—a beautiful love story. I knew it would be unlike any other,
              and I was certain my story would be unique to readers.
            </p>
            <p>
              I paid to print a few copies and shared them with friends, who
              then shared them with others. That encouragement made me
              determined to find a way to get
              <strong><em>The Bracelet</em></strong> out there. I found a
              promoter, but their business closed. Then, I submitted
              <strong><em>The Bracelet</em></strong> to Book Trance Media, and
              they accepted it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Meanwhile, my friends who had read
              <strong><em>The Bracelet</em></strong> begged me to write more
              about the characters and what happened next. I was happy to write
              the second book, <strong><em>The Touchstone</em></strong
              >, for them. Soon after, they asked for even more.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: center">
              I had to believe in myself to write a third book— and that book,
              <strong><em>The Promise</em></strong
              >, is the longest I have ever written.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: center">
              I am forever grateful to those who encouraged me and stood by me
              all these years.

            <h3><i class="fas fa-book icon"></i>My Journey</h3>
            <p>
              I was raised in
              <span class="journey-highlight">Lakewood, Colorado</span> near the
              gorgeous <span class="highlight">Rocky Mountains</span> and
              <span class="highlight">Flat Irons</span>. There is nothing more
              breathtaking than the sunsets over the Rockies, which is what my
              paintings portray. <br />
              <br />
              I currently reside in
              <span class="journey-highlight">Fort Morgan, Colorado</span>, 80
              miles from my beloved mountains. Inspired by this marvelous state,
              I wrote three books rich in
              <span class="journey-highlight">Colorado's heritage</span>. <br />
              <br />
              Over the years, I have hiked, biked, and camped in the Rockies,
              and those adventures have deeply influenced my writing. The
              emotions from these experiences pour onto the pages of my books.

            <h3><i class="fas fa-pen-fancy icon"></i>Poetry</h3>
            <p>
              Time permitting, I have written poetry over the years from the age
              of 8. My first poem was about the
              <span class="journey-highlight">CV- Ranch</span>, where we rode
              horses and embraced the lessons of the trail. <br />
              <br />
              During my Junior High years, our family moved to
              <span class="journey-highlight">Louisville, Colorado</span>, where
              we had a perfect view of the
              <span class="journey-highlight">Flatirons</span> near Boulder. In
              7th grade, I wrote
              <span class="journey-poem-title">Ode to a Clock</span>, which was
              featured in
              <span class="journey-highlight">The Boulder Camera</span>
              newspaper.
              <br /><br />
              My poetry spans a range of themes, including the
              <span class="journey-highlight">Vietnam War</span> and the
              suffering it brought, as well as deeply personal topics. I have
              written about my
              <span class="journey-highlight">father’s absence</span> and how he
              never danced with me, along with poems about
              <span class="journey-highlight">love</span> and the emotions it
              stirs.

            <h3><i class="fas fa-users icon"></i>Family</h3>
            <p>
              When my three children came along, I devoted myself fully to them,
              never missing an event they participated in. They are now adults
              with their own families, and I am blessed with many grandchildren
              and one great-grandson.
              <br /><br />
              I have two grandchildren still living in
              <span class="journey-highlight">Fort Morgan</span>. One, at 25, is
              on his own, while the other, at 15, lives with us when his father
              is working. He brings me immense joy and light. I cherish each and
              every relationship with my grandchildren. Some I have cared for
              into perpetuity, and others, though living far away, have spent
              significant time with me. Together, we've shared experiences such
              as
              <span class="journey-highlight">Tea Houses, Escape Rooms</span>,
              and any activities they wished to pursue. Words cannot express how
              much they mean to me.
